# Chimera

Chimera is a granular synthesizer whose waveforms are generated by analyzing the frames of a live camera with a maximally sized discrete Hilbert curve which samples the pixels with which it intersects and translates them to time- or frequency-domain waveforms which can then be played on a keyboard.

## Development plan

- Beta
-- A prototype Android app written in Processing and a basic Audio library
-- An interface like a keyboard that mixes the time- and frequency-domains depending on the location of the click/touch along the length of the key, and a menu allowing this configuration or disabled time- or frequency-domain options
-- The same app using Supercollider
- 1.0
-- The same app translated to Openframeworks, with releases for iOS and Android
- 2.0
-- The same app with the option to output to WebMIDI, allowing live performance worldwide, served with Laravel Forge or Heroku using a Docker environment, and written with a Vue app
- 2.5
-- An allowance for recording loops, saved to a database; a Chimera left on a tripod could record a setting sun as the sound encoded as the changes of a loop's timbre

## Future uses

As one instrument in a small set that makes up a composition, Chimera could be coupled with a sometimes-quantized timeline generated by Markov chains controlling percussive sounds generated with additive and frequency-modulation synthesis.
